## Overview
### Description
Share the Table is the new dating app designed for foodies! Users will create a profile about themselves, similar to a dating app, and answer questions about their food preferences. This app will allow users to find other users to "share the table" with and have a meal at a new restaurant, cafe, bar, etc. The user will be able to swipe left or right to match with other users (and their top wishlist for food spots) and message them to set up a time to have a meal.
